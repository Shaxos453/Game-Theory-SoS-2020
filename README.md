# Game-Theory-SoS-2020
This repository contains the report on Game Theory that I completed in fulfilment of the Summer of Science project, 2020 under the Maths and Physics club of IIT Bombay.

A game is any interaction between multiple people in which each person's payoff is affected by the decisions made by others. How does one analyse these games and decide the best course of action? I answer this fundamental question while covering all the bases in this insightful report on the intriguing field of Game Theory.


My principal references for this report were the recorded lectures of the ECON 159 course taught by Professor Benjamin Polak in the Fall of 2007 at Yale University available through the Open Yale Courses initiative.
